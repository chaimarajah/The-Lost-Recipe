# Code of Conduct

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.

- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.

- Focusing on what is best for the community.

- Showing empathy towards other community members.s

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.

- Public or private harassment.

- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

- Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in which it occurs.

All Billing_System forums and spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all content on The-Lost-Recipe's GitHub repository, as well as at all official The-Lost-Recipe's' events, whether offline or online.

The Code of Conduct also applies within project spaces and in public spaces whenever an individual is representing The-Lost-Recipe. Examples of representing a project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed or de facto representative at an online or offline event.

## Conflict Resolution

When multiple contributors disagree on the direction for a particular patch or the general direction of the project, the conflict should be resolved by communication. The people who disagree should get together, try to understand each other's points of view, and work to find a design that addresses everyone's concerns.

This is usually sufficient to resolve issues. If you cannot come to an agreement, ask for the advice of a more senior member of the project.

Be wary of agreement by attrition, where one person argues a point repeatedly until other participants give up in the interests of moving on. This is not conflict resolution, as it does not address everyone's concerns. Be wary of agreement by compromise, where two good competing solutions are merged into one mediocre solution. A conflict is addressed when the participants agree that the final solution is_better_than all the conflicting proposals. Sometimes the solution is more work than either of the proposals.

## Reporting Violations

Violations of the Code of Conduct can be reported to The-Lost-Recipe's Project Steward:

chaima rajah ([](chaima.rajah@medtech.tn)). The Project Steward will determine whether the Code of Conduct was violated, and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a written warning or expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces, or project forums. We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your conflict via the conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.

Violations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those unrelated to the project. We will only consider complaints about conduct that has occurred within one year of the report.

## Enforcement

If the Project Steward receive a report alleging a violation of the Code of Conduct, the Project Steward will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an opportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The Project Steward will do their utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as someone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g. threats of violence), the Project Stewards may issue sanctions without notice.

## Questions

It's always ok to ask questions. Our systems are large, and nobody will be an expert in all the systems. Once you find the answer, document it in the first place you looked. That way, the next person will be brought up to speed even quicker.
